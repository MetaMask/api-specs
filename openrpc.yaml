            When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes
            place in a shared environment, typically called 'the context of the
            conversation.' This shared context allows the individuals to use
            shortcut terms, such as the first name of a mutual friend, to
            communicate more quickly without losing accuracy. A context in
            JSON-LD works the same way: it allows two applications to use
            shortcut terms to communicate more efficiently without losing
            accuracy.
