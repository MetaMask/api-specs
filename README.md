# Metamask API Specs

JSON-RPC API provided by Metamask.

Both Ethereum client developers and downstream dapp developers lack a formal RPC specification. This attemps to document which methods Metamask supports in a way that's versionable, human-readable and machine-readable. It will improve the accuracy of documentation, API, and clients.

Much of Ethereums effectiveness as an enterprise-grade application platform depends on its ability to provide a reliable and predictable developer experience.
